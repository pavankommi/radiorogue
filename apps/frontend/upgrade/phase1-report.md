## Commits

1. `chore(radiorogue): upgrade TypeScript to 5.7.2 and Node types to v22 LTS`
   - Hash: f57a758
   - Changes: Updated TypeScript from 5.x to 5.9.2, @types/node from 20.19.12 to 22.18.0

## Notes

### What Worked
- TypeScript upgrade was smooth with no breaking changes
- @types/node upgrade to v22 LTS (stable) caused no issues
- All existing TypeScript code compiles without errors
- No type definition conflicts

### Observations
- `npm update` did not update any other packages as all are at their latest minor/patch versions
- Build shows API fetch errors but these are runtime issues, not build failures
- ESLint warnings about using `<img>` tags are pre-existing and not related to this upgrade

### Recommendations for Phase 2
1. Proceed with Next.js 15 upgrade using automated codemods
2. Keep React at 18.3.1 for stability
3. Address ESLint warnings about image optimization after Next.js upgrade
4. Consider implementing proper error boundaries for API fetch failures

## Phase 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All Phase 1 objectives achieved:
- ✅ TypeScript upgraded to latest
- ✅ @types/node upgraded to v22 LTS
- ✅ npm run lint passes
- ✅ npm run build succeeds
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ Commits follow naming convention
